# SeetaFace Engine with CMakeLists.txt modified
*By Apr. 02, 2018*

Project Location: [SeetaFaceEngine](https://github.com/liyaoplus/SeetaFaceEngine)

------

SeetaFace Engine is a good and practical set of face image processing tools. But I found that there were some errors in compiling and inconvenience in testing.

So I modified several CMakeLists.txt files and \*test.cpp files, in order to make them easy building and testing.

Only support building in Linux, I haven't tested it under Windows.

The usages keep unchanged, just following the previous READMEs.

Finally, thanks to SeetaFace Engine.
